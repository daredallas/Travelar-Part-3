			Our prototype used Marvel App as the platform to create our prototype, it allowed us to take our static photos representing each screen and link them together. Many of the interactions which we wished to demonstrate with our prototype were transitions between screens, and Marvel supports having multiple transition options from each screen. Marvel allows for defining ‘hotspots’ which result in a transition to another screen, this was perfect for us as it allowed for simulating accurate button presses with a custom sized hotspot over an icon in the background image.<br><br>

Before we decided on Marvel App for our prototype, a specific interaction which would need to be considered was how we would return to the correct source from a page which could be reached from multiple sources. For instance, the options menu can be reached from multiple screens but if we wanted to define any sub menus within the options menu, we would need to define the entire tree of screens beneath the options menu for each unique way to reach the options menu. Marvel answered this problem quite simply in that it supports a ‘last visited’ option of linking screens and the method of creating hotspots with custom size and interaction meant that we did not have to modify our static screens to be compatible in any way.<br><br>

There are limitations of Marvel App in the context of our prototype, but we do not believe that it harms the demonstration of intended function in a major way. The most notable difference between our prototype and a finished product is that the application would use the camera and gyroscope of a mobile device for a live view of the users immediate surroundings. As Marvel App does not support using these types of sensors in any way, we chose to simulate motion through a camera view with a scrolling picture which ends on a static view. As a result of this limitation the next phase of the project will have to include describing this intended interaction to the participants, which may be beneficial for the testing situation. If we had a working gyroscope and camera in our prototype we would instead have to simulate locations of interest while testing inside of the computer lab at UVic, which would not correctly illustrate how this is meant to be used while traveling.<br><br>

An interaction which we intended to implement was being able to enter text for the purpose of logging in, leaving a review, and editing a profile. Marvel is limited in that does not support text entry while testing the prototype, so we had to consider an alternative. In our prototype, text entry is simulated by a screen transition from an empty text field to a completed one. This shows the process of proceeding through each screen, and assumes that a prototype tester would understand the intended text entry interaction that is being simulated.
