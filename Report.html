<h2>User Requirements</h2>
	<br>

<b>Requirement 4.0: Create opportunities for businesses to connect with potential customers: </b><br><br>
The locations can add their customized profiles to the app and users can review the places, the feedback can be later viewed by business owners and customers ideas can be implemented, complaints can serve as ways to improve the way the business operates.
 The app also shows contact information that can easily be accessed if, for example, the user wants to book a reservation for another date. 
<br><br>
<b>Requirement 4.1: Provide recommendations and alternatives to immediate location:</b><br><br>
We have implemented a way for related nearby attractions that might be interesting for the user.
 The implementation involves a bright and vibrant tag system so that they can be visible to the user and be immediately obvious.
	Also, since multiple tags are featured, users can find a variety of similar locations because we can only use metrics to suggest the most popular options.
			<br><br>
<b>Requirement 4.2: Connecting users to the locations around them through the app, presenting landmark locations with special interface and information:</b><br><br>
The application can display more than one location at once but has a maximum so that only the most popular destinations show up.
	Also, these labels can be tapped to lead to a more detailed view with a smooth swiping transition that resembles other functions on the phones that involve transitions.
	In addition, the pop-up only takes up part of the screen so that the user can still have a visual reference to the location that they are getting information about.
