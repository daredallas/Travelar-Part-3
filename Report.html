<h2>Prototyping Tools</h2>

			
			<h3> </h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">
	The screen descriptions were initially outlined and sketched in a group meeting on a whiteboard. This is where brainstorming took place and a variety of design schemes were created. 
After the initial mockups, a Google Doc was created with a detailed description of screens as well as requirements, scenarios, and personals. 
Screen mockups were created using Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop. This allowed flexibility and fine control of screens to match the desired aesthetic.
The initial demo was created using a screen recorder and the Google Slides App to simulate interaction.
For the high-fidelity prototype, Marvel App was used to link screens and create an interactive demo.
