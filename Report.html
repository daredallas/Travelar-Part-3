<h2>Prototyping Tools and Process</h2>

			
			<h3> </h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">
The screen descriptions were initially outlined and sketched in a group meeting on a whiteboard. This is where brainstorming took place and a variety of design schemes were created. After the initial mockups, a Google Doc was created with a detailed description of screens as well as requirements, scenarios, and personals. Screen mockups were created using Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop. All the animations were made in Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro. This allowed flexibility and fine control of screens to match the desired aesthetic. The initial demo was created using a screen recorder and the Google Slides App to simulate interaction.<br><br>
For the high-fidelity prototype, Marvel App was used to link screens and create an interactive demo. Once Marvel was decided as the intended method of creating a prototype, another document was created that outlined the process of linking the screens together according to the interactions the HTA outlined, and the document also defined the screens which would need to be created to demonstrate all of the desired interactions.The process of creating the prototype on Marvel was then started with placeholders for these missing screens. This involved linking the screens together, testing that they were correctly implemented, and repeating these steps when new screens were added.<br><br>
