<h2>Usability Goals</h2>		

<p>
Able to provide specific user interfaces for different situations (keyboard, star rating, directions): all scenarios we chose for the app (and more) can be easily executed: reading reviews, leaving reviews, menus, finding information, finding directions. The app allows for a variety of ways to get from A to B for example: to go back the user can either tap the back button or tap outside of the bubble <a href="screen 3" target="_self">(screen 3)</a><br><br>
Controls can be used in both landscape and portrait orientation: user has to flip the phone and the AR camera will be in landscape.<br><br>
Able to preload nearby location data when the app is opened: app works in the background and based on the location 10 nearest locations automatically.<br><br>
Able to provide relevant data for locations within a second (if not preloaded): this requirement is acheived thanks to fast algorithms<br><br>
Able to collect user information anonymously to improve services: App asks for permissions to gather location information and anonymous interactions( “people that go here also go to x”). Popular locations can be used to mark trending restaurants <br><br>
New users able to find their first interactive location within 30 seconds of opening the app (not including the time it takes them to input their login credentials, which is only a few fields) - the app opens to AR view so it is reasonable to expect the time to be less than 30 seconds.
<br><br>
Rating a location takes less than 30 seconds + the time it takes to type in a comment: once the user points on the location there’s at most 3 clearly visible buttons (“name of location” -> “more” -> “review”) they have to press to leave a review. The user can also take the following path: “name” -> “review stars” -> “review”, the stars serve as a hidden button that takes the user directly to the list of reviews, where the user will also be able to see the "review" button. It is reasonable to expect that the user will take one of those routes and see the review menu after a few seconds. The “post” button is clearly visible.
<br><br>
Minimal learning curve: the user should remember how to perform a task after having perfomed it once: all actions take at most 4 taps (not including typing comments, usernames, emails, descriptions) and all buttons are clearly labeled, for some actions there are more than one route the user can take to achieve their goal.<br><br>
The app should not allow the user to get lost in their surroundings: the user can see the directions on the screen and compare them with the world around them. The AR view is not obstructed by buttons that are too large so the user can clearly see what’s on the screen. <br><br><br>
