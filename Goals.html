<h2>Goals</h2>

			
			<h3>Goals for Stakeholders - features we have introduced in the app that will help the stakeholders acheive their goals</h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">
	
	<b>Travel agencies: </b> Travel agencies can improve their customers experience by introducing them to the app. Customers are more likely to enjoy their trip if, for example, they find an interesting building and can instantly find out what it is and potentially book a tour or visit the restaurant if they like it. If the customers are bored they can point at a place and see if they want to visit it, or visit something similar to that location in the vicinity of that place. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Attractions and businesses: </b> They can collect feedback through reviews. By gathering good reviews, they can invite more customers to their location. For example, if a user sees a restaurant that’s too busy, the app can take them to the nearest restaurant with the same tag. Since the restaurants are sorted by rating, the user is likely to pick one of the top restaurants on the list. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Local governments: </b>local governments benefit from the app in a very similar way as businesses (above). Additionally, if users only end up going to the places with better reviews, all locations with bad reviews will get fewer customers and if they don’t make enough money they will be replaced with other locations that will new, possibly better ones, which is good for the whole community. <br>
<b>Travel bloggers: </b>the bloggers will be able to provide higher quality content thanks to the apps ability to show reviews (bloggers will be able to pick the best locations) and through the app’s suggestions (based on the tag, the bloggers will be able to find similar, maybe better locations). This will overall increase the amount of locations they can recommend and will result in more content they can put on their blog. It will also result in specialized content, the bloggers will be able to pick what audience they want to appeal to, for example medieval restaurant lovers, and make content based on that specific criterion.<br>

<h3>Goals for Customers</h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">

Saving time searching for information: instead of looking for a sign and looking its contents up on google (what if the sign is in another language/alphabet?) the user will be able to point at it and see info in their own language.
<br>
<br>
Saving time searching for locations: the user doesn’t have to google what they are looking for, they can just open the AR camera or click on a tag<br>
<br>
Saving money: showing tags with prices “$”, “$$” and “$$$” after the user clicks on a location. Users will be able to skip expensive locations with bad reviews by sorting through locations by rating and price<br>
<br>
Discovering new information and locations - the main premise of the app, built in functionality such as tags, location, AR<br>
<br>
Satisfaction with the product's features - the users will be able to achieve their goals without struggle, the information in the app is up to date and accurate.<br>
