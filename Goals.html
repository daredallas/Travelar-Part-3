<h2>Goals</h2>

			
			<h3>Goals for Stakeholders - features we have introduced in the app that will help the stakeholders acheive their goals</h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">
	
	<b>Travel agencies: </b>
	<p>Travel agencies benefit greatly from this as they help direct customers to install the app on their phones and explain all of its benefits. They can also use this as an opportunity to point out locations they partner with.
		The app enhances the user experience during the trip, which will result in higher ratings for the agencies as well as chance of users recommending it.
	</p>
	
	<b>Attractions and businesses</b>
	<p>Businesses are able of increasing their audience by signing up for a business profile and providing information about the location.
	They can do so directly by users pointing their phones to the store or indirectly by tagging their establishment to associate it with similar ones. Lastly, highly rated businesses will stand out to potential customers, increasing possible sales. 
	</p>
	
	<b>Local Governments</b>
	<p>Local governments can boost the tourism industry by marking landmarks and historical sites. This will make tourists more aware of these attractions. Reviews and pictures will also make customers want to visit the sites
	</p>
	
	<b>Customers</b>
	<p>Customers benefit by having a simple and intuitive way to discover new places. It provides the autonomy to discover compared to a tour guide, and is accessible at anytime.
	Customers will be able of finding highly rated places and discover similar attractions to ones they could not visit.
