<h2>User Experience</h2>

<p>Presents information to user in easy to digest way: We believe the app is not cluttered and only displays the most relevant information, which is easy for the user to digest. <br><br>
Provides responsive visual feedback after inputs and newly loaded information: The app provides visual feedback by briefly changing the icon of pressed icons and buttons to a darker shade. Menus are labeled with conventional buttons (gear for settings, 3 dashes for menus)<br><br>

Able to direct user to features to avoid confusion: the main menu button (top left) is the conventional three bar icon that a lot of users are alrady familiar with. For new users who just opened the app bubbles are displayed instructing the user on what to do to find a place, filter or open the menu. It also tells the user when they need to get closer to the location (or zoom in).<br><br>

Engages users to explore unique locations or landmarks: the app has a large database of locations, providing the user with information not only about the more popular locations but also the less known ones. <br><br>
Interface integrated with AR background in a non distracting way (info bubbles clearly associated with each location, info bubbles do not obstruct view through phone): bubbles move as the camera moves, only a limited amount of bubbles is visible at a time (up to 3). If more bubbles appear on the screen, the app picks 3 most popular (according to user reviews) locations, and tells the user to get closer or zoom in to see more locations.<br><br>
AR button clearly displayed and eye catching on startup screen, or app opens to AR camera: we have decided to have the app open to AR camera (or welcome screen if user is not logged in and takes the user to AR camera after login) to make the experience easier and more intuitive.

<br><br>
Creates desire to explore surroundings: The app is engaging, shows the user interesting places in an aesthetic and non obstructive way. The buttons make the user want to click them and explore the locations. Creates desire to explore surroundings.<br><br><br><br></p>
