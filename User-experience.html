<h2>User Experience</h2>
<br>
<p>
<i>Presents information to user in easy to digest way:</i>
<br><br>
The prototype distributes the relevant information slowly, revealing more after each interaction as to not overload the user with information. For instance, to see the full page of the restaurant in our prototype, the user will identify the colour of the bubble as a restaurant, a click reveals the summary (a brief overview, the name, and rating), and finally click more to reach the full page of options available. This process of clear identification and labeling reduces the clutter and supports meeting this requirement. <br><br>

<i>Provides responsive visual feedback after inputs and newly loaded information:</i>
<br><br>
The prototype uses transitions to provides feedback after the user interacts with a icon or button. We were not able to implement the intended animation of changing the icons to a darker shade when an interaction occurs, but the current method always indicate when input occurs with a transition to another screen. The prototype also makes use of the Marvel app feature which shows all interactable areas when a user clicks on a non-interactable area. 
<br><br>
<i>Able to direct user to features to avoid confusion: </i>
<br><br>
The user interface implemented in the prototype utilizes consistent colouring, identifiable buttons, and conventionally styled icons to help alleviate user confusion on a given screen. Users will know they are on a restaurant page by the purple icons and header colour, and be able to infer the result of interacting with the familiar 3-line settings menu and back arrow. New users are shown a help message bubble to direct them to the next intended interaction, but due to the prototype lacking the full functionality of camera sensors we did not include help messages for when the user is too far away from the location.
<br><br>
<i>Engages users to explore unique locations or landmarks:</i>
<br><br>
Because of the static and limited scope of the prototype we do not have a large database of locations for the user to explore, but the prototype does illustrate how the bubbles would display on locations of interest. These bubbles encourage the user to engage with the information about locations which they may not have identified as notable.
<br><br>
<i>Interface integrated with AR background in a non distracting way:</i>
<br><br>
The limited scope of the prototype does not fully illustrate the responsiveness of a full implementation with camera and gyroscope sensors, but the coloured bubbles on our static example of a users view do show how we would integrate the location data with the background. The bubbles allow for the user to see what information about the nearby locations is available at a given time, without completely obstructing the surrounding view.
<br><br>
<i>AR button clearly displayed and eye catching on startup screen, or app opens to AR camera:</i><br><br>

The buttons overlaid on the AR view are clearly distinguished by their bright colouring and design to draw users attention to locations. The prototype opens to a static AR view after logging in to demonstrate how the possibilities for new information would immediately be presented in a full AR view.
<br><br>
<i>Creates desire to explore surroundings:</i>
<br><br>
The prototype does not support exploring with the AR view as the full app does, but the buttons help to create interest in what would otherwise be a building unknown to the user. In this way the app engages the user to explore the information provided to them.<br><br><br>
